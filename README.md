# Dynamic Dependency Injection in Java

This project demonstrates a dynamic dependency injection mechanism in a Java application using reflection. The main goal is to create an application where the specific implementation classes of the DAO (Data Access Object) and Metier (Business Logic) layers can be specified at runtime, enabling greater flexibility and decoupling between components.
